## Timeline

The competition is divided into two distinct phases to ensure the models generalize well to unseen future data.

### 1. Development Phase (Public)
* **Purpose:** Tune your models, perform feature engineering, and validate your approach.
* **Data:** You are provided with a large training set and a smaller validation set.
* **Feedback:** When you submit, your score on the leaderboard is calculated using the **Public Test Set** (Development data). You can submit multiple times per day to improve your ranking.

### 2. Final Phase (Private)
* **Purpose:** Determine the final winners based on the model's ability to predict the most recent groundwater levels.
* **Data:** Your model will be trained on the same training data, but evaluated on a completely new **Private Test Set** (Final data) from a later time period.
* **Selection:** You must choose your best submission from the Development Phase to be re-run against the Final Phase data.
* **Restriction:** You may only make **Two** submission to this phase, so choose the model that you believe is most robust, not just the one that overfitted the public leaderboard!
